# Axxess-jupyter

#### Example uses of Axxess in a Jupyter notebook

[Axxess](https://github.com/DANS-repo/axxess) is a Java library to convert MS Access databases to and from csv files. Axxess can be configured with a java property file. Axxess is an excellent companion when working with MSAccess databases in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). It can read MS Access databases and write data and metadata to csv files. It can also reconstruct MS Access databases from csv files. There's no need to get a Java Jupyter kernel, Java installed on the system will do.

Axxess is built on the excellent Java library [Jackcess](http://jackcess.sourceforge.net/).
